          <p>I start my learning journey by my self before even i reach high school
          i go against the wing when all of kids were playing flash games i was
          playing with f12 and trying to download flash games I heared of the
          power of linux so i installed it play withit that’s got me into
          hacking, electronics (script kiddie), Then i wonder how this tools is
          working so that’s got me into programming i start with python i
          learned the basics of it and having no idea how to use this power so i
          start automating some tasks (automate the boring stuff with python).</p>
          
        </div>

        <div className={styles.p2}>
          <p>Automating tasks got me into web scraping whish makes me realise how
          stuff i have learned is used (javascript and databases) so, i decide
          to start similar projects to practice I also get into JS frameworks
          Like React NodeJS NextJS whish makes it easier to see the abstract
          view of your app wish makes it easy for maintenance and scaling all of
          that’s brought the need for system design and design pattarns for
          better quality products that’s can scale and alow mulltiple poeple to
          works on.</p>
